# Description
Get-NetView is a tool that collects local system and network configuration data, to streamline diagnosis of Windows networking issues.

# Installation
## PowerShell Gallery
To install this module from [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/), run:
```PowerShell
Install-Module Get-NetView -SkipPublisherCheck -Force
```
It is also part of `MSFT.Network.Diag`, which can be installed with:
```PowerShell
Install-Module MSFT.Network.Diag
```

## Disconnected or air-gapped systems
If your servers are disconnected or air-gapped, use:
```PowerShell
Save-Module Get-NetView C:\SomeFolderPath
```
Then move the Get-NetView folder (from `C:\SomeFolderPath`) to `C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules` on your target server.

## Direct Execution
This script also supports direct execution:
```PowerShell
Invoke-WebRequest "aka.ms/Get-NetView" -OutFile "Get-NetView.ps1"
.\Get-NetView.ps1 -OutputDir .\
```
If blocked by execution policy:
```PowerShell
Powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File  .\Get-NetView.ps1 -OutputDir .\
```

# Usage
To begin data collection, simply run:
```PowerShell
Get-NetView
```
The output is saved to `Desktop\msdbg.<username>`, and can be inspected with any file manager. On completion, a .zip file is created for easy sharing.

For additional help and advanced options, run:
```PowerShell
Get-Help Get-NetView
```

This tool is also run automatically by [Get-SDDCDiagnosticInfo](https://github.com/PowerShell/PrivateCloud.DiagnosticInfo) by including the -IncludeGetNetView parameter.
